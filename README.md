# Android-App-for-Children-Development

The growth and development of children has always been the focus of the international community. With the development and popularisation of information technology, the growth and development records of children have gradually changed from traditional paper form to electronic form. As the final year project of BUPT and QMUL, I designed and implemented a child development health record application which is based on the Android platform, including the client side and the server side. 

Based on the parameters of children's height, weight, head circumference and Body Mass Index entered by parents on a regular basis, this application can draw the changing growth curves of children, and compare these with the international standards of the World Health Organisation and the standard of nine representative provinces and cities in China, to give personalised evaluation results and recommendations. At the same time, according to parentsâ€™ input of their child growth milestone content, the application can compare these milestones with international standards, again giving further evaluations and recommendations. 

This child development health record application realises the long-term dynamic monitoring and evaluation of children, and provides help for parents to identify developmental problems at an early stage.
